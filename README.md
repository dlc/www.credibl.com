Templates, Modules, and Content
===============================

This repository stores the templates, modules, and content as it is saved
and published in Movable Type, and stores it all for easy retrieval. The
saving is to be done via post-save hooks in the Movable Type interface.

Documentation on these hooks is at http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/developer/objects/callbacks.html.
